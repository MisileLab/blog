The [jamsync](https://jamsync.dev) is open-sourced and it is rsync-based efficient version control system.
git-lfs is hosted in gitlab and use in the github modules using git-submodules.

The jamsync repository will hosted after many big files and it needs in github repository.

## Limitations

Limitation is git-submodules can't used and use the jamsync with sh or cmd(i don't use windows btw).
so maybe... jamsync is not updated actively after 1 month. (because pijul isn't updated actively now.)
